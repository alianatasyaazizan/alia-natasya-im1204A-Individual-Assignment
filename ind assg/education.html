	<p> <font size="5"> From the age of 7 to 12 I have been attended primary school at 
<a href="https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekolah_Jenis_Kebangsaan_(C)_San_Yuk"> SJK(C) San Yuk.</a> Is anyone in my family chinese?? That's the answer that I always got because I went to school in SJK(C). However, I was actually schooled in a Chinese school because when I was in kindergarten I went to a Chinese language school which when I entered primary school, I was suggested by one of my kindergarten teachers to persue my third language in Chinese when entering grade 1 because I was considered fluent and smart. Alhamdulillah, I learned a lot about racism and religion of other races and I also survived to go to school in SJK (C) even though I am a Malay. </p></font>

	<p><font size="5"> After 8 years of learning Chinese in a Chinese school, I feel tired and want to start a Malay school. Therefore, I attended high school a malay highschool called

<a href="https://semarakrawang.edu.my/">SMK Tun Perak.</a> Many things I learned for the first time because for the first time I had so many Malay students around me. I was a bit culture shocked at first but I SURVIVEDD AGAIN!!! From this school I started to build my identity and have many new friends until now.

<p> <font size="5"> My first university is <a href="https://kedah.uitm.edu.my/">UiTM Kedah.</a> However, to continue my studies in the library field, is not my first choice. It was the first choice of my mother who felt the library was the best place to teach my child to be less active because she felt I was too talkative. Even though the choice is not my desire, I still like whatever I study as I don't know what I'm going to do and I don't continue learning.
